    external-labels:
        description: |
          A JSON string with key-value pairs that specify the The labels to
          attach to metrics in this Prometheus instance before they get pulled
          by an aggregating parent. This is useful in the case of federation
          where you want each datacenter to have its own Prometheus instance
          and then have a global instance that pull from each of these
          "children" instances. By specifying a unique set of external_labels
          for each child instance, you can easily determine in the aggregating
          Prometheus instance which datacenter a metric is coming from.
          Ex. '{ "cluster": "datacenter1" }'
        type: string
        default: "{}"
