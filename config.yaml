    external-labels:
        description: |
          A JSON string of key-value pairs that specify the labels to
          attach to metrics in this Prometheus instance when they get pulled
          by an aggregating parent. This is useful in the case of federation
          where, for example, you want each datacenter to have its own
          Prometheus instance and then have a global instance that pulls from
          each of these datacenter instances. By specifying a unique set of
          external_labels for each datacenter instance, you can easily determine
          in the aggregating Prometheus instance which datacenter a metric is
          coming from. Note that you are not limited to one instance per
          datacenter. The datacenter example here is arbitrary and you are free
          to organize your federation's hierarchy as you see fit.
          Ex. '{ "cluster": "datacenter1" }'. Both keys and values may be
          arbitrarily chosen as you see fit.
